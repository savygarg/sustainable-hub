        Goal 9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable
        industrialization, and foster innovation to drive economic growth,
        social development, and climate action. Despite progress like 95% global
        mobile broadband coverage and increased investments in research and
        development, challenges such as declining manufacturing, supply chain
        issues, and inequalities in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) remain.
        Collaboration across governments, NGOs, and the private sector is
        crucial to ensure sustainable practices, infrastructure investments, and
        equitable opportunities worldwide.Without action, achieving poverty
        eradication and broader sustainable development goals will become more
        difficult, underscoring the need for collaboration among governments,
        NGOs, and the private sector to establish sustainable industrial
        practices, invest in infrastructure, and advocate for equitable
        opportunities worldwide.
