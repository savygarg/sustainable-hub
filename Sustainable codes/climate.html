            Climate change, driven by human activities, represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time,
            threatening life on Earth as we know it. Rising greenhouse gas emissions are accelerating global warming,
            leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread disruptions to ecosystems. If left
            unchecked, climate change could reverse decades of development progress, exacerbate global inequalities, and
            provoke mass migrations, conflicts, and devastating natural disasters. To prevent these outcomes, we must
            limit global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels by halving emissions by 2030. However, the world
            is significantly off track, and urgent, transformative action is required across energy, industry,
            agriculture, and transportation sectors. Global initiatives
            like the Paris Agreement mark important steps forward, but far greater ambition and commitment are necessary
            to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and secure a sustainable and equitable future for all.
