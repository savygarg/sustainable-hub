            <p>SDG 8 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, productive employment, and decent work
                for all. While global labor productivity has improved and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in 2022
                (down from 6.6% during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic), major challenges persist. High youth
                unemployment, informal work, gender pay gaps, and unsafe working environments continue to hinder
                progress. Women and young people were disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with nearly 1 in 4
                youth (289 million) not in education, employment, or training in 2022. Despite this, women have shown a
                stronger recovery in employment than men. Achieving this goal requires systemic reforms to address
                rising debt, economic uncertainties, and trade tensions. Key solutions include investing in quality
                education and skills training, fostering equitable pay, providing social protection, and ensuring safe
                and secure workplaces. Governments must also work to create dynamic, inclusive economies that prioritize
                youth employment, women's economic empowerment, and decent work opportunities for all, ensuring no one
                is left behind in the drive for sustainable growth and improved living standards.</p>
