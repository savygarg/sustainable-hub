            Goal 14 focuses on conserving and sustainably using oceans, seas, and marine resources, which are vital for
            life on Earth. Covering three-quarters of the planet, oceans contain 97% of its water and 99% of living
            space by volume. They provide critical resources like food, medicines, and carbon storage, while acting as
            natural buffers against storms. However, oceans face severe threats, including pollution, plastic waste, and
            rising acidity, endangering marine life and food security. Marine heatwaves and coral reef destruction from
            climate change exacerbate the issue, while mismanaged tourism and overfishing add further strain. Urgent
            action is needed to protect this vast yet fragile resource, which supports livelihoods, regulates the
            climate, and offers immense potential for scientific discovery and human health benefits.
