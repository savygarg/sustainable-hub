        <p>The world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets but not fast enough. At the current 
            pace, about 660 million people will still lack access to electricity and close to 2 billion people will 
            still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking by 2030. The Goal is about ensuring access to 
            clean and affordable energy, which is key to the development of agriculture, business, communications, 
            education, healthcare and transportation. Renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable 
            and more efficient every day.Our current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, 
            which is why we have to change the way we produce and consume energy. Energy efficiency and increase use of 
            renewables contribute to climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction. Maintaining and protecting 
            ecosystems allow using and further developing hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy. Implementing 
            these new energy solutions as fast as possible is essential to counter climate change, one of the biggest 
            threats to our own survival.</p>
