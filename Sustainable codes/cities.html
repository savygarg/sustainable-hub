            SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. With over half
            of the world's population already living in urban areas, this figure is projected to rise to 70% by 2050,
            further straining infrastructure and resources. Currently, approximately 1.1 billion people live in slums or
            slum-like conditions, with an additional 2 billion expected in the next 30 years, mostly in developing
            countries. Many cities are struggling to keep up with rapid urbanization, leading to issues like inadequate
            housing, pollution, and limited access to essential services such as public transportation. Individuals
            also play a crucial role in advocating for
            responsible urban development, engaging in local governance, and ensuring that their communities are planned
            with safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability in mind.
