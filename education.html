        The Quality Education goal aims to ensure inclusive, equitable, and
        quality education while promoting lifelong learning opportunities for
        all. It focuses on reducing disparities in access and quality,
        particularly for vulnerable groups such as poor children, those in rural
        areas, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, and refugees.
        Significant progress has been made since 2000, with primary school
        enrolment in developing regions reaching 91% by 2015 and out-of-school
        children halved. By 2030, the goal seeks to ensure free primary and
        secondary education for all, equal access to affordable vocational
        training, and the elimination of gender and wealth disparities in higher
        education. It also emphasizes the importance of empowering individuals
        through education to achieve economic growth and break the cycle of
        poverty. Achieving this goal would pave the way for creating more just,
        inclusive, and sustainable societies globally.
